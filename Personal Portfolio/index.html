				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>My name is Ashna Jagadisan. I am 16 years old and currently in grade 11. My hobbies include computer science, violin, and photography!</p>
				<p></p>
				<p><a class="link" href="file:///Users/ashna1/Downloads/Coding/B99%20GAME/project/index.html">Here</a> is a link to an interactive game I created using HTML and CSS. The game is about the tv show, Brooklyn Nine-Nine.
				<p>I am very interested in STEM and wish to go to university for Software Engineering. I want to go to Catalyst in order to gain first-hand experience in engineering and broaden my skills. The Catalyst Conference would also allow for me to get a feel for the university environment and meet engineering students who can answer the many questions I have regarding post-secondary education. I am a very hardworking, an analytical thinker, have strong interpersonal skills, and fast-learner, and if selected for the program, I will apply my best skills in science and engineering in order to contribute to Catalyst.</p>

					<h2>Teens Learning Code Workshops</h2>
					<h3>Participant</h3>
					<p class="date">June 2017, July 2017, August 2017</p>
				</div>

				<div class="description">
					<p>Over the course of the summer, I participated in many workshops with Canada Learning Code as a part of Teen Club. This was my first taste of coding and where I found my passion for computer science. I still remember the motivation and satisfaction I felt after my very first workshop, where I had been able to create a very basic webpage using HTML and CSS.</p>
				<p> I also vistited the Cisco Toronto Office with Teen Club, which is another one of my most memorable experiences. At Cisco, I was able to see and understand the applications of coding first-hand as well as the learn fundamental requirements of a software company.</p>

				<div class="description">
					<p>After discovering my passion for coding and computer science, I wanted to be able to apply my own knowledge and skills. Though my skills at this time were very limited, this overnight hackathon was yet another amazing experience that allowed me to work in a group among other driven and talented individuals.</p>
					<p>At the hackathon, I worked alongside my friends to create a webpage that displays a new song recomendation when a song name is inputed. </p>
